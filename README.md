This is an ongoing project in order to teach myself web-desing and computer programming.
The goal is to have a reliable and accurate database for all things related to vintage Honda motorcycles.
Relevant information will include bike specs, pictures, a brief history of development and production, fair market value, and if available,
interactive parts fiche and links to an affiliate website to order parts.

> JavaScript functions will be implemented soon!

If you would like to get involved in the research, send an email to blainerice08@gmail.com! Credit will be given where it is due.
