<h1>Why doesn't anything work?</h1>
<p1>First, I am starting with the earliest Honda's (1947-1950), and then I will move to more popular models, such as the CB's and small trail bikes. Secondly, thank you for visiting my webiste! This is a personal project that I am using to teach myself computer programming and web-development. This website is in the very early stages of development, and as you can see, there is a lot of work to do! Feel free to save this to your favorites as I will constantly be updating it with more information. Thank you! -Blaine E Rice</p1>
