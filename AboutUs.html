                <h3>Our Experience and What We Do</h3>
                <p>This is a place for all things related to vintage Honda motorcyles, spanning from the first A-Type in 1947 to the screaming Honda CB's and hotrod Magnas of the late 80's and early 90's. Created by Blaine E Rice, who previously owned and operated a restoration shop dedicated to getting old Hondas back on the road. This shop was Agape Cycles and was located in Broken Arrow, OK for 3 years. </p>
