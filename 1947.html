    <h1>1947-1949</h1>

      <h3>In the beginning...</h3>
      <p>Honda Motorsports got their start in motorcycles in 1947 with the "A-Type", which was a motorized bicycle. Surplus generator engines from World War II were installed onto bicycle frames known as the "A-Type", which shared the same name as their 50cc 2-stroke engine. However the first full frame and engine motorcycle was not available to the market until 1949 with the "D-Type", also known as the Honda Dream</p>
