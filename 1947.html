    <h1>In the beginning...</h1>
        <p>Founded by Soichiro Honda, Honda Motorsports got their start in motorcyles in 1947. They installed 2-stroke 50cc surplus generator engines left over from World War II onto the A-type bicycle frame, which shared the same name of the engine. This design model remained largely unchanged until 1949 with Honda's own design of a 2-stroke 98cc full-fledged motorcycle known as the "Honda Dream", also known as the Type-D and D-Type. This name came after a quote from Mr. Honda, saying "It's like a dream", referring to the way the bike handled.</p><br>
    <h2>The 1948 "B-Type"</h2>
        <p>There is not much information over the B-Type, except for a few prototypes. This 3-wheeled service car model seems to have been discontinued before it reached the production line. However, this was the first model to sport a 90cc 2-stroke engine.</p>
